Project Title: 
Predicting Medical Malpractice Injury Settlements using the National Practitioner Data Bank

Project Description: 
Through the use of the National Practitioner Data Bank dataset on Medical Malpractice, it has motivated our research question: What are the best predictors for the probability of a malpractice case resulting in a higher payout (greater than $500,000)? This document contains several files utilized in processing and examining the data set. 

What files to run and in what order?
This zipped folder includes two primary RScripts. The correct order in which to run this data would be: 1st) the RScript labeled “NPBD_Cleaning.R,” and 2nd) the script labeled “NPBD_Modeling.R.”

Disclaimer: Since the final project submission method is a shareable zipped file– we are not including the original data set. Therefore the only script that can be run is the modeling file along with the cleaned data set provided in csv format.

Where can I get the original data file?
Due to its size, we have omitted the original data set. However, this file may be accessed at the National Practitioner Data Bank’s website, the link specifically is: https://www.npdb.hrsa.gov/resources/publicData.jsp. The data acquisition process is quick– a short survey to complete with the researchers information as well as an email address the data can be sent to. The original file contains over 1,676,479 rows and 54 columns. 

In order to circumvent this issue, we have included a csv file containing the final cleaned data set. This file is labeled “NPDB.csv” and can be used to run the modeling script.

Within this zipped file you will also find the written report that accompanies our work. It is an APA formatted pdf document that is labeled “MDML_FinalProject.”
